                    PRODUCT DESIGNER (CONTRACT WORK)
                    <br>
                    2 WEEKS, SUMMER 2023
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="https://www.handledelivery.com/">Handle Delivery</a> is a student-run delivery service founded by students at USC. With branches at 5 different universities across the nation,  Handle promises to deliver snacks, beverages, and more within 15 minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    I teamed up with another talented designer and one of my best friends, <a href="https://www.hansonleung.co/">Hanson Leung</a>, for this project. We worked together with the Co-Founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaserobbins1/">Chase Robbins</a>, to create a new rewards feature. I was responsible for the beginning and the end: research and framework, then prototyping and components.

                    SOME RESEARCH AND SKETCHES
                    <br><br>
                    From the very beginning, the Handle team made their expectations for the new rewards feature very clear (as all great clients should). This feature had to compliment their existing design system, with the expectations of increasing user engagement and in-app spending. Bonus points if the feature is fun and animated.
                    <br><br>
                    Users are awarded for completing certain app-related tasks (e.g. “referring a friend”, “spending $10”) with store credit or product coupons.
                </p>

            <div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="lowfi-1.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        The brainstorming process began on paper. Inspiration was grabbed from real-world bingo cards, stamp sheets, and punch cards. Early concerns about potential limitations were also noted down on these pieces of scrap paper.
                        <br><br>
                        The vertical orientation of stamp cards worked best with the dimensions of a mobile phone. Bingo cards didn’t fit as nicely, but gave users the freedom to <em>choose</em> which tasks to complete.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">

                    <p>
                        The messy sketches were used to create three different ideas. For some of these ideas, I tried to keep the design form of stamp cards without restricting users to a set list of tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        I presented these ideas to the Handle team through a series of “stop-motion” screens. This helped communicate what the  expected high-fidelity animations might look like with just a fraction of the effort.

                    WORKING SOME MAGIC
                    <br><br>
                    As my first leg of the project was coming to an end, I started experimenting with prototyping the low-fidelity screens. This exercise doubled as a quick review of Figma’s prototyping interface. I also wanted to test Figma’s limits before considering whether I needed to turn to other prototyping platforms (i.e. ProtoPie or Principle). Two test prototypes were created after receiving client input.
                    <br><br>
                    (A) The first prototype features a stamp and stamp card. The fun stamping animation was a cherry on top.
                    <br><br>
                    (B) The second prototype allows users to track their progress towards collecting adorable spinoffs of the Handle mascot (in addition to receiving store credit or product coupons) with a progress bar.

                    Unfortunately the project was cut short. Despite the excitement that was shared by both parties about the potential for this new rewards feature, Handle faced some structural challenges that led to the termination of this project.

                    WHAT I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE
                    <br><br>
                    I was sad to end the project when there was still so much potential and so much more left. Here’s a short list of what could have been done and some of my own personal notes and considerations to fully prepare prototype A for Handle’s platform.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            How would the stamp card animation be adjusted to make room for a hamburger menu or other navigation icons?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What would have to change with Handle’s current, static branding styles in order to accommodate for the zooming in and out of the stamp card?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What are the upper and lower limits for different punch cards? Could there be punch cards with 10 holes? 12 holes? How about an odd number of holes?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How would the rewards feature integrate into the existing Handle home page? A new button? An entirely new page on the navigation menu?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Should users be able to view all completed stamp cards? What would this look like and where would this be?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
