                    PERSONAL NOTES
                    <br>
                    ***
                    <br><br>
                    This page is a growing collection of notes about startups, products, and companies in the autonomous vehicle (AV) technology space—a growing space that I aspire to design in. 
                    <br><br>
                    These scraps double as a love letter to AV. It’s a confession caked with potential user journeys, messy scribbles, and half baked ideas. Everything is in here, even the crazy ones.
                </p>

                BUILT FOR RIDERS, NOT DRIVERS
                <br><br>
                Zoox is an AV company that is developing an autonomous ride-hailing service that operates in especially dense environments (e.g. San Francisco, Las Vegas). It is founded in 2014, headquartered in Foster City, and currently lead by female CEO Aicha Evans. 
                <br><br>
                Unlike many of its competitors, Zoox is one of the few companies within the AV space that redesigned their vehicles around the experiences they’re trying to foster. Instead of borrowing the driver-focused interior and exterior designs of modern cars, why not make these vehicles reflect the new driverless experiences? AV is a competitive, saturated space, and Zoox has become one of my favorites for championing human-centered design in everything they do.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="zoox-1.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        No need to bend over backwards to talk to those behind you—Zoox’s symmetrical design makes it easy. The interior seating of Zoox’s vehicles supports and encourages conversations between riders by eliminating the physical barriers that make it hard to maintain eye-contact.
                        <br><br>
                        The car’s symmetrical design also means that the car doesn’t have a “front” or a “back,” it can drive in any direction at any time.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="zoox-2.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        Riders can play their own music and change temperature settings at any time. Their route and ETA is always just a click away.
                        <br><br>
                        These micro-experiences are something that are especially interesting in the emerging AV space. How should users interact with fully-automatic, self-driving cars? What about their environment should they be able to change in order to make themselves more comfortable? What shouldn’t they be able to change?
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-block" style="margin-bottom: 125px;">
                These interactions and experiences, whether they be human-to-human or human-to-interface are something that I want to explore and challenge. And so, I have a few ideas to suggest.
