                    PERSONAL NOTES
                    <br>
                    ***
                    <br><br>
                    This page is a growing collection of notes about startups, products, and companies in the autonomous vehicle (AV) technology space—a growing space that I aspire to design in. 
                    <br><br>
                    These scraps double as a love letter to AV. It’s a confession caked with potential user journeys, messy scribbles, and half baked ideas. Everything is in here, even the crazy ones.

                BUILT FOR RIDERS, NOT DRIVERS
                <br><br>
                Zoox is an AV company that is developing an autonomous ride-hailing service that operates in especially dense environments (e.g. San Francisco, Las Vegas). Founded in 2014, Zoox is headquartered in Foster City and currently lead by female CEO Aicha Evans.  
                <br><br>
                Unlike many of its competitors, Zoox is one of the few companies within the AV space that redesigned their vehicles around the experiences they’re trying to foster. Instead of borrowing the driver-focused interior and exterior designs of modern cars, why not make these vehicles reflect the new driverless experiences? AV is a competitive, saturated space, and Zoox has become one of my favorites for championing human-centered design in everything they do.

            <div class="text-block" style="margin-bottom: 125px;">
                MAKE IT FEEL SAFE
                <br><br>
                Despite the progress shown by Zoox and other AV companies, the public has become hesitant in adopting this new technology due to recent accidents involving AV. 
                <br><br>
                But AV is still learning! What can be done to help the public feel safe? Where does <em>feeling</em> safe begin?
                <br><br>
                I searched through articles and interviews to see how the public’s worries and doubts were being addressed—what ideas have been proposed, what partial solutions already exist, and what hasn’t been tried just yet.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
                <div class="l-img">

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-block">
                I started noticing gaps within two different areas of the AV ride-hailing experience.
                <br><br>
                1) The onboarding experience for AV services is the first thing users see. But it isn’t too drastically different from the onboarding experiences of non-AV, ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber. Shouldn’t it be? Why not provide users with more information about AV and AI to help them feel safer?
                <br><br>
                2) AV vehicles are smooth, slick, and sexy. But these designs (from Zoox and others) aren’t optimized for differently abled individuals, especially for those that are visually impaired. Projects like <a href="http://www.tactilecity.org/">Tactile City</a> utilize brightly colored and patterned surfaces to assist visually impaired individuals navigate busy cities. Why not create a similar system for AV vehicles?
                <br><br>
                These suggestions are, of course, just suggestions. Maybe, one day, I’ll create a new case study and further explore how these suggestions can be brought into the real world—exploring what they would look and <em>feel</em> like. Until then, I’ll keep these notes safe here.

                THE BEST DELIVERY EXPERIENCE NOT ON EARTH
                <br><br>
                I first heard about Zipline during my freshmen year of college. I was assigned to read about Zipline’s life-saving autonomous drones, in a class called “Case Studies in Innovation.” Our class had focused on Zipline’s drone delivery services in Rwanda, Africa, that specialized in delivering vital medical supplies to regional health care facilities, dramatically decreasing the number of deaths in Rwanda.
                <br><br>
                Earlier this year, Mark Rober, an ex-NASA engineer and now Youtuber, published a video about Zipline’s new short-range city drones. Not only had Zipline developed new drones to tackle other delivery niches, they had also rebranded themselves. This rebranding is what I found to be incredibly surprising and fascinating.

                Thank you to Jeova Farias, my professor during an intensive 3-week AI + Python summer course at Brown University. I credit him for exposing me to AV and all the necessary ethical considerations behind AI.
                <br><br>
                Thank you to professor Davina Wolter, a faculty member at the USC Iovine and Young Academy, for providing me with many incredible resources about design accessibility.
                <br><br>
                Special thanks to Micah Panama, current creative director of Zipline, for some of the best career and life advice. Thank you for taking time out of your busy day to talk to me, an excited college student that randomly reached out to you on LinkedIn.
