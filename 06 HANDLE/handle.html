                    I teamed up with another talented designer and one of my best friends, <a href="https://www.hansonleung.co/">Hanson Leung</a>, to create a new rewards feature for <a href="https://www.handledelivery.com/">Handle Delivery</a>, a student-run delivery service.

                    Project Objectives
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the very beginning, the Handle team made their expectations for the new rewards feature very clear (as all great clients should). This feature had to compliment their existing design system, with the expectation of increasing user engagement and in-app spending.

                    Ideation & Low-Fidelity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The brainstorming process began on paper. Inspiration was grabbed from real-world bingo cards, stamp sheets, and punch cards.

                <p>
                    Low-fidelity sketches were drawn alongside quick notes.

                    The messy sketches were used to create three different ideas.
                    <br><br>
                    I presented these ideas to the Handle team through a series of “stop-motion” screens. This helped communicate what the  expected high-fidelity animations might look like with just a fraction of the effort.

                <p>
                    The clients wanted the animations to be more fleshed out so I created two test prototypes all in Figma.
                    <br><br>
                    (A) The first prototype features a stamp and stamp card. The fun stamping animation was a cherry on top.
                    <br><br>
                    (B) The second prototype allows users to track their progress towards collecting adorable spinoffs of the Handle mascot (in addition to receiving store credit or product coupons) with a progress bar.

                    Unfortunately the project was cut short. Despite the excitement that was shared by both parties about the potential for this new rewards feature, Handle faced some structural challenges that led to the termination of this project.

                    <p style="width: 100%;">
                        I was sad to end the project when there was still so much potential and so much more left. Here’s a short list of what could have been done and some of my own personal notes and considerations to fully prepare prototype (A) for Handle’s platform.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            How would the stamp card animation be adjusted to make room for a hamburger menu or other navigation icons?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What would have to change with Handle’s current, static branding styles in order to accommodate for the zooming in and out of the stamp card?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What are the upper and lower limits for different punch cards? Could there be punch cards with 10 holes? 12 holes? How about an odd number of holes?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How would the rewards feature integrate into the existing Handle home page? A new button? An entirely new page on the navigation menu?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Should users be able to view all completed stamp cards? What would this look like and where would this be?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
