                    Figma's in-app communication tools are lacking, with few built-in collaboration options for designers. I wanted to address this issue, aiming to enhance team communication without the need for external platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    This design challenge was completed as part of the 2023 Kleiner Perkins Fellowship application.

                <h2>
                    Pain Point Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my internship at Work & Co, a digital product agency (read more about my experience <a href="../01 WORK CO/work-co.html">here</a>), I realized how frustrating it was to work together with other designers on the same project. 
                    <br><br>
                    We designed our products on Figma, but we had to flip back and forth between Figma and Slack to communicate with other team members.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="gallery">
            <div class="m-img">
                <img src="painpoint-1.png">
                <p>
                    In Figma, we created a separate page to track the list of tasks we needed to do before each check-in with our client. 
                    <br><br>
                    This method did not provide our team with details about the location of the task, the progress towards task completion, or whether a team member needed help.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="m-img">
                <img src="painpoint-2.png">
                <p>
                    We also tried updating each other by leaving comments on our Figma files to help better communicate when we needed help. 
                    <br><br>
                    But this quickly became very messy. It was hard for us to discern which comments and tasks were related. It also became hard to organize older comments and to locate relevant comments when we needed them in the future.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>
                    User Interview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I conducted 6 interviews with Figma users of varying platform experience to better understand how everyday users juggle between Figma and other third-party messaging platforms. 
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    The key takeaways from the interviews revealed that these same pain points were felt by a lot of different Figma users. Regardless of their background and current occupation, Figma’s collaborative tools just weren’t enough.

                    <p style="width: 100%;">
                        For this design challenge, I focused on tackling two main pain points.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Organization. Create a system that allows users to delegate project tasks in an organized space.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ease. Users should be able to reference these collaborative tools on Figma anytime, anywhere. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="width: 100%;">
                        The redesigned user flow enables users to stay on Figma’s platform throughout the entire collaborative process, allowing users to avoid the headache that came with the original, multi-platform method of communication.

                    Users can add a new task on Figma by clicking on the purple “+” icon at the bottom right hand corner. Task information can be added right away or changed at a later time. Tasks can be assigned to a team member and users can add “Tagged Individuals” so that selected team members are notified whenever task information or task progress is changed or updated.

                        Before the Task Tool can be published as part of Figma’s collection of tools, there are still a few more things that need to be done.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            How else can the Task Tool be used? Conduct more user interviews to better understand the pain points of teams AND independent designers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Can clients also use the Task Tool? Research what cross-platform integration might look like and new user flows.
