                    12 WEEKS, SUMMER 2022
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="https://work.co/" target="_blank">Work & Co</a> is a digital product agency dedicated to shipping award winning websites, apps, and digital experiences that are used by millions of people every day.
                    <br><br>
                    During the summer of 2022, I interned at Work & Co as a design intern. I helped with conceptual development, user flows, design systems, and mockups of hundreds of screens.

                    SHH... A QUICK SNEAK PEAK
                    <br><br>
                    The first project I worked on was Kresus, a multi-purpose crypto wallet. Working alongside amazing strategists, copywriters, and designers, I was able to help with multiple different deliverables. I got to try my hand at designing frameworks, design systems, user flows, and more. 
                    <br><br>
                    Here are some samples of the work that I completed for this project.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
                <div class="l-img">
                    <img src="framework.png" style="width: 100%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-block" style="margin-bottom: 125px;">
                <p>
                    I spent my first few weeks exploring frameworks and user flows. How will users get from the gallery view to each PDP? What is the expected user interaction or CTA? What might that look like? 
                    <br><br>
                    Here are a few of my favorite iterations and explorations (above). With feedback from the client, we ultimately settled on the final variation (above, third row).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
                <div class="l-img">
                    <img src="module.png" style="width: 100%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-block" style="margin-bottom: 125px;">
                <p>
                    Designs were cleaned up, components were made, and full page modules were created for several different pages. I assisted with developing these modules, finding assets, and updating our designs with components.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="components.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        I organized and put together the final component library that was delivered to the client. This library included a variety of reusable elements: buttons, carousels, and content blocks as well as colors and font styles.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="icons.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        During some extra time in-between sprints, I designed a collection of vectorized logos and icons that was presented to the client as add-on elements and assets.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-block" style="margin-bottom: 125px;">
                <p>
                    There is much more work that was completed that is not shown here. Research, low fidelity mockups, and bare-bone sketches aren’t included in these few snapshots of the Kresus project. Most of the many (many!) rejected designs may never see the light of day.

                    LEARNINGS & TIDBITS
                    <br><br>
                    Design agencies are like marriage consultants. Well established companies don’t lack the internal resources to design and build the products they want, instead they hire digital product agencies looking for something else. Usually, they’re stuck in a dilemma, unsure of how to push their own brand. Or, they’re experiencing internal conflicts and there are disagreements about the direction of a new project. That’s where agencies like Work & Co come in: acting primarily as designers and professionals, but also as listeners and consultants that are there to assist with making necessary strategical decisions.
                    <br><br>
                    When a choice needs to be made between keeping your team or keeping your client, always prioritize your designers and employees. Work & Co champions this philosophy, and have “fired” unhealthy clients in the interest of their teams. Post project reviews also ensure that the agency continues to improve internally, seeing if new rules need to be implemented in order to protect the team from certain types of clients in the future.
                    <br><br>
                    Delicious snacks and food are key to happy designers and employees. Whenever mac & cheese is on the menu, run, don’t walk.
