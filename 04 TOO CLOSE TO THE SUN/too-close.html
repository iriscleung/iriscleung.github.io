                        PASSION PROJECT
                        <br>
                        1 WEEK, WINTER 2022
                        <br><br>
                        I normally gravitate towards working on visual + UX design projects, but I rarely get to really <em>build</em> my own designs. Usually I hand projects off to a developer or resort to drag-and-drop website builders like Webflow, Wix, or Squarespace. But I’ve been itching to take on a project, and be responsible from beginning to end.
                        <br><br>
                        So I pushed myself to start a personal project where I can do everything, from research to design to both frontend and backend development.
                        <br><br>
                        I’ve named this project “Too Close to the Sun”. It’s a growing collection of memories that I’ve made with my friends through documented events and pictures. With the help of a few coding classes, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL to build this project entirely from scratch during a one week sprint.                
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="case-study">

                    GATHERING SCRAPS
                    <br><br>
                    This project was built from a bunch of scraps. Nothing was <em>truly</em> original. I knew the development of the site was going to take up a majority of the project timeline, so I made sure to recycle site elements from some previous projects when possible.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="scraps-1.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        The inspiration for the name of this passion project was part of a documented quote from my close friend & roommate, Ayonnah Tinsley.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="scraps-2.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        The site hierarchy was roughly based off of an in-class project, called IYA Yearbook that was completed during the 2022 fall semester.
                    </p>

            </div>
            <div class="text-block" style="margin-bottom: 125px;">
                <p>
                    Even though I wanted to prioritize the development of the site, I still wanted to make sure that this site looked and felt great. So I spent the first two of the seven days code free.

                    LIFE IS LIKE A MOVIE
                    <br><br>
                    My last two years at college have been amazing. My friends agree, life has been like a movie. 
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted the look of the site to reflect this shared sentiment and wanted to design the site to look similar to the promotional sites used for motion pictures, film festivals, and creative studios. This meant large, full screen videos and images, with limited copy text only where absolutely necessary (otherwise let the visual assets tell the stories). 
                    <br><br>
                    I looked to <a href="https://a24films.com/">A24</a>, a film and television production company, and <a href="https://www.hugeinc.com/">Huge</a>, a digital marketing agency based in Brooklyn, for site inspiration. I learned and borrowed a few things from these sites.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Simple nav bars (and even simpler site hierarchies).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On-scroll text animations look great, but use them sparingly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Not all assets are created equal. Prioritize the assets that fit the best with the text that’s being used.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    With these notes, I focused on two pages of Too Close to the Sun: the Home page and the Details page.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="animation-1.gif" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        On the Home page, users can swipe through different memory collections. The background shows a blurred preview of some of the images inside the collection.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="m-img" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="animation-2.gif" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        Each Details page showcases all of the images within a collection, along with the image details. The event description follows the user as they scroll through the images.
                    </p>
