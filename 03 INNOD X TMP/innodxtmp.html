                    WEB TEAM LEAD
                    <br>
                    10 WEEKS, FALL 2022
                    <br><br>
                    Trojan Marketplace (TMP) is a biannual, student-run market event featuring student-owned small businesses. They aim to uplift the entrepreneurship community at USC by featuring 50+ businesses each semester.
                    <br><br>
                    TMP reached out to USC’s creative agency club, Innovative Design (InnoD), for help with designing and creating their website from scratch. I lead a small team (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arellayangg/" target="_blank">Arella Yang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-chen-b500b9211/" target="_blank">Cynthia Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dayonlee/" target="_blank">Dayon Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresatran7151/" target="_blank">Teresa Tran</a>) to design and develop this new website from head to toe in a span of 10 weeks.
                    <br><br>    
                    I was responsible for leading my team through the process of creating a website and developing a brand identity while also teaching Figma basics, introducing Webflow’s interface, and communicating with the clients. I spent off hours working with team members 1-on-1 to provide portfolio advice, to guide them through self-led exercises, and to answer questions big or small (what’s the difference between agency and in-house? what’s the difference between good UI and great UI?). Ultimately, I wanted to <em>build their confidence as designers</em> and I wanted them to end the semester with the skills necessary to become a team lead themselves.

                    PLANNING THE MEETINGS
                    <br><br>
                    At the beginning, I adopted a meeting format that mimicked day-long art studios—I wanted everyone to solve a problem together, live, in the same room. We had to keep meetings on Zoom to accomodate everyone’s schedules, but team meetings were arranged to be several hours long so that a majority of the work can be completed together.
                    <br><br>
                    Everything took place in a Figma + FigJam melting pot. Everyone was able to provide live feedback and iterate on the spot. The longer meeting format also allowed me to better understand how each team member thinks, how they approached a problem, and how they handled feedback.
                    <br><br>
                    Our deadlines were kept flexible so that I would be able to accomodate my team’s experience levels on the fly. Some needed more help with Figma while others had no prior experience with Webflow. I scheduled separate 1-on-1 lessons to ensure that everyone would be on a level playing field during our jam sessions.

                    WIGGLING OUR PROCESS
                    <br><br>
                    My team’s process was a bit unconventional to the typical InnoD process. I wanted to allow my team to learn as much as possible—to conduct user interviews, to experience presenting to the clients, and to have the <em>wiggle room</em> to explore and push in certain parts of the process. This meant that there was more work on my end, but these were meaningful learning experiences that I was happy to facilitate.
                    <br><br>
                    I made sure to ask all of my team members a handful of questions within the first week.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            What do you want to get out of this project?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Is there a specific part of the process that you want more practice with?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        How can I best support these goals as a team lead?
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    My team very quickly expressed interest in conducting face-to-face user interviews. Unfortunately, InnoD’s project structure did not give us the time for user interviews, so I <em>made</em> the time for my team. This meant that some weeks were busier than others, but my team was more than willing to make this sacrifice. 
                    <br><br>
                    From moodboards and information architectures to low/mid/high fidelity prototypes, my team was constantly flipping back and forth between branding and site design. We communicated with TMP’s own team of designers to discuss a new brand identity. Some weeks we worked on site design as we waited for feedback on branding, while other weeks it was the opposite. We quickly came to understand and pivoted our own project schedule to fit TMP’s timeline.
                    <br><br>
                    Within 8 weeks, we created a site design that we were proud of, a site deisgn that the clients were excited about, all while implementing the needed changes that were recommended during our earlier user interviews.

                        Team notes from user interviews with past TMP vendors. Interviews were conducted in pairs while information architectures and low fidelity prototypes were being created.

                    HACK NIGHT
                    <br><br>
                    Hack night was a 5 hour long, heads-down work session. The goal was to build the entire website on Webflow in one meeting. Of course, I wanted my team to have fun while tackling such a daunting task.
                    <br><br>
                    I asked everyone to bring snacks, potluck style. We exchanged Webflow tips while catching up with each other’s lives, discussing upcoming plans, and cracking jokes about past regrets. It was a memorable night for my entire team. Hack night helped us better understand each other as <em>people</em>, beyond the comfortability we had with each other as teammates.
                    <br><br>
                    Other InnoD team leads began asking me for advice for their own team hack nights. My advice was simple, <em>make it fun</em>.

                    THE FINALE
                    <br><br>
                    As of November 20, 2022, there are still some minor tweaks that need to be made to the TMP website. A temporary site can be found <a href=https://www.trojanmarketplace.com target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <p>
                        The final home page filled with real copy and assets from TMP and student vendors. Developed in Webflow in time for the event on November 15th.

                    Special thanks to my team of designers, Arella Yang, Cynthia Chen, Dayon Lee, and Teresa Tran, for growing with me, working thorugh my mistakes with me, and for cheering me on as I cheered for you girls too. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you to Melis Kolat and Sarah Hakim for being such amazing clients. It was incredible getting to be a part of such an impactful event, and even more incredible to watch your team work behind the scenes.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you to the entire eBoard of InnoD for entrusting me with this responsibility. And to the rest of InnoD for making this past semester so incredibly motivating.

                    Thank you to Tanya Chen, my team lead from last semester for building my confidence as a designer. If not for her, I wouldn’t have been a team lead this semester.
